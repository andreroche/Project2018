# Project2018 - Programming and Scripting

# Project Overview:
The Project plan is presented in Microsoft Project as this a software that is ideally suited to creating project plans and highlighting critical paths. Supporting the plan is a Gantt chart as a graphical aid. In addition, the plan and the Gantt chart are attached as a pdf in the event that the MS Project file cannot be opened and viewed.

The project plan defines the project in detail. It establishes schedule, deliverables and scope and ensures that all risks are identified and prioritised in a timely manner to ensure milestones are achieved.
Research, investigation and summary of findings are all presented within the final report and this is attached as both .docx and .pdf titled 'Final Report'.

The python programming to support the report is attahed as FinalProject2018.py. All other python files are attached to show logical timely progression and learnings.

To run the python file FinalProject2018.py, please ensure the iris data set is installed in a folder called Data in the working directory and is named iris_dataset.csv (Example C:\Users\aroche2\Desktop\GMIT PYTHON\Data\iris_dataset.csv).

You may need to install various library's within the python environment as many are called within the program. All come packaged with anaconda.

All references for both programming and reporting are contained in the final report section titled references.
