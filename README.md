# Project2018 - Programming and Scripting

# Project Overview:
The Project plan is presented in Microsoft Project as this a software that is ideally suited to creating project plans and highlighting critical paths. Supporting the plan is a Gantt chart as a graphical aid. In addition, the plan is attached in MS Excel and the Gantt chart is attached as an image file in the event that the MS Project file cannot be opened and viewed. 
The project plan defines the project in detail. It establishes schedule, deliverables and scope and ensures that all risks are identified and prioritised in a timely manner to ensure milestones are achieved.
Research, investigation and summary of findings are all presented within this Readme file.
Supporting python code and relevant instructions for using this file(s) is uploaded to this respository in the format of .py files.  

# Research and Investigation into Fisher's Iris Data Set:
Introduced by Ronald Fisher in a 1936 paper titled 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems', it is an example of linear discriminant analysis. The data set itself is a mutivariate data set, that is to say it contains two or more variable quantities. Specificially it contains data of three Iris flower species. They are Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica. Four geometric features were recorded from the three species and 50 samples of each were gathered. They were Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length and Sepal Width. Linear discriminant analysis is a statistical method used for classification and pattern recognition (to distribute things into groups, classes and categories). Today it is commonly used in applications such as machine learning.
